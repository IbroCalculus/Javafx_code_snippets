--- Drag and drop the tablewView

--- To add more columns, drag in the tableColumn

--- Assume table name "table1" and columns title are Name, Address, Age with IDs; name, address, age respectively

============ FXML ==========
NB: Take note of the ? which will be replaced later on

    @FXML
    private TableView<?> table1;

    @FXML
    private TableColumn<?, ?> address;

    @FXML
    private TableColumn<?, ?> age;

    @FXML
    private TableColumn<?, ?> name;


--- Create a Model class to be used for populating data on the table; ie Student: ----------

    private String nameM;
    private String addressM;
    private int ageM;

 --- Generate constructor as well as getters and setters ---


--- FXML --------
Replace the ? ? with the java model class and the data type respectively. ie: Student Integer, and do as shown below it.

    @FXML
    private TableView<Student> table1;

    @FXML
    private TableColumn<Student, String> address;

    @FXML
    private TableColumn<Student, Integer> age;

    @FXML
    private TableColumn<Student, String> name;
    
    ObservableList<Student> list1 = FXCollections.observableArrayList(
            new Student("Ibrahim", 27, "Nigeria"),
            new Student("Suleiman", 18, "Algeria")


------- ALSO DO, ----------------
 
    @Override
    public void initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb) {
        // TODO

        name.setCellValueFactory(new PropertyValueFactory<Student, String>("nameM"));
        age.setCellValueFactory(new PropertyValueFactory<Student, Integer>("ageM"));
        address.setCellValueFactory(new PropertyValueFactory<Student, String>("addressM"));
        
        table1.setItems(list1);
    }
