This is when two javafx widgets (ie an input and a label (textview)) are synchronized or linked together
Such that a change in one is immediately reflected in the other. 
E.g Type in the text field, immediately the text will reflected in the label.

There are of 2 types; Unidirectional binding and bidirectional binding.

---- Unidirectional ---------
Changes in one widget is binded to the other, but not the other way round.
E.g a textfield and a label, type in textfield is reflected in the label instantaneously.

--- Bidirectional -------
Changes in one widget is binded to ther other, likewise changes in the other is binded to the former, Works both ways.
E.g two textfields binded to each other, type in any is reflected in the other.



============= E.g ================

    @FXML
    private Label lbl1;

    @FXML
    private PasswordField pswdField1;

    @FXML
    private TextField txField1;

    @FXML
    private TextField txField2;


    @Override
    public void initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb) {
        // TODO
        lbl1.textProperty().bind(txField1.textProperty());                      // Unidirectional. NOTE the order, lbl1....txFieild1, NOT txField1....lbl1
        txField2.textProperty().bindBidirectional(pswdField1.textProperty());   // Bidirectional
