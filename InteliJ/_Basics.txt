 
 CREATING NEW JavaFX project in NETBEANS

 There are two ways to create a javaFx project in Netbeans;
 1. is such that the project will be written in codes using Java. (Good to learn this for a start)
 2. is such that it will be configured to be designed with Scene builder. (I normally use this one)
 
 FOR 1. New -> Project -> JavaFX -> JavaFx Application -> Check only "Create Application Class"
 FOR 2. New -> Project -> JavaFX -> JavaFX FXML Application -> Check only "Create Application Class"
 I normally use 2, work with "Scene builder"

 
 BASIC STAGE SETUP
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 250);
        
        primaryStage.setTitle("Hello World!");
        primaryStage.setScene(scene);
        primaryStage.show();
 

 CREATE NEW FILE (ie .css file) WITHIN A JAVAFX PROJECT FOLDER
 FOR 2. Right click -> New -> Other -> Other -> Empty File -> Application.css
 

 JavaFx application are faster compared to Swing or AWT applications.

 
 A JavaFX project when created has 3 files:
 1. Main.Java
 2. Controller
 3. sample.fxml

 TERMS:
 -1. Stage: Similar to a JFrame in Swing or root window. It is the main window
 -2. Scene: Similar to a panel in Swing, it is placed inside of a stage. Add widgets on scene
