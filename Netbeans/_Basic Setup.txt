CHECK: How to install java 11.0.6

NB: Don't forget to clean and build after every modification in either the Netbeans and Scenebuilder, for this changes to be applied.
NB: After series of failures running javaFx on Apache Netbeans, I researched, experimented and came up with the solution as indicated.

1. New Project -> Java Ant -> JavaFX -> JavaFX FXML Application (JavaFX Application does not contain FXML, hence don't use that)

2. Right click on the project -> Properties

3. Run -> Vm Options:
--module-path "C:\Users\USER\Downloads\Compressed\openjfx-17.0.1_windows-x64_bin-sdk\javafx-sdk-17.0.1\lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
(The path "C\Users\..." is where the sdk is presently located on my device).
NB: I ignored this part, but it still worked

4. Still within Properties; -> Libraries

5. "Compile" tab -> Modulepath ->> + ->> Add Library ->> javafx-sdk-17.0.1
6. "Compile" tab -> Classpath  ->> + ->> Add JAR/Folder ->> within javafx-sdk-17.0.1 lib folder, select and open all the .jar files (presently 8 files)

7. "Run" tab -> Modulepath ->> + ->> Add Library ->> javafx-sdk-17.0.1

OK and Exit the pane

9. Clean and Build, ignore the red error output

10. Run project from within the .java(NOT Controller.java) and NOT the entire project

11. After every modification, Clean and build before running to apply the changes
